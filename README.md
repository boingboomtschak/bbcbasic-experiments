# BBC BASIC Playground

A collection of BBC BASIC experiments, mostly intended for tweeting at the [@bbcmicrobot](https://twitter.com/bbcmicrobot) and thus will be able to be shortened and base2048 encoded to 280 characters. 

More documentation on the specifics of the bot and shortening code enough to fit into a tweet on the [user guide for the bot](https://github.com/8bitkick/BBCMicroBot/blob/master/docs/user%20guide.md).

### Guidance

A couple resources I've found that are super helpful in writing code for this bot, as well as playing around with BBC BASIC:

- [The official "getting started" page from the @bbcmicrobot website](https://www.bbcmicrobot.com/learn/index.html)

- [The user guide from the bot's GitHub page](https://github.com/8bitkick/BBCMicroBot/blob/master/docs/user%20guide.md)

- [An online editor and emulator for the BBC Microcomputer](https://bbcmic.ro/)

- [A write-up by Paul Malin with some useful reference code, especially for the GFX module](https://blog.mousefingers.com/post/bbc/bbc_reference/)

- [RISCOS.com's reference manual for BBC BASIC](http://www.riscos.com/support/developers/bbcbasic/)

- [A tool written by 8bitkick to minimize VDU codes into strings to further minify code](https://8bitkick.github.io/vdu/)
